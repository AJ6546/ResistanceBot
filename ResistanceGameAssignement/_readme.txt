I have added some more input features which gave the bot higher performance. 

I have added a copy of the resistance framework with ap21903.py file (Assignemt folder). Please use it.

Otherwise in case you want to train the classifier and check the accuracy results, 
please add the loggerbot.py to bots folder. Make sure there is loggerbot.log file in logs folder
and run:
py competition.py 10000 bots/intermediates.py bots/loggerbot.py

Add ap21903.py to the bots folder and use the classifer_loggerbot.ipynb. 
Place the classifer_loggerbot.ipymb in the root forlder. 

Add loggerbot_classifier in the bots folder, If you don't want to create model again.

Please run cometition atleast 10000 times to get good results
py competition.py 10000 bots/intermediates.py bots/ap21903.py
